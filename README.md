# To run the Matlab code
1. Use the V-component of the macro-images in HSV color space and the corresponding cross-over value given in the .csv files named Train and Test.
2. Aug1 to Aug9 folder contains the augmented versions of the V-component.
3. To download the dataset fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTJQxN80A3tb8UzWX5aJrXtcCLCFoOzLRLI073H31MVnlcTw/viewform) and contact us and we can provide a link to all the images.
4. Unzip the file and put all the folders and matlab files to the working directory.
5. We have split the dataset into train and test.
