Vipin Das, Malaya Kumar Nath, "An EfficientNet-based modified sigmoid transform for enhancing dermatological macro-images of melanoma and nevi skin lesions", Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,Volume 222, 2022, 106935, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106935.

# To run the Matlab code
1. Use the V-component of the macro-images in HSV color space and the corresponding cross-over value given in the .csv files named Train and Test.
2. Aug1 to Aug9 folder contains the augmented versions of the V-component.
3. Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/16cAy-1tdscR1L-FtJ8k2w185TK0Ddyog/view?usp=sharing
4. Unzip the file and put all the folders and matlab files to the working directory.
5. We have split the dataset into train and test.
